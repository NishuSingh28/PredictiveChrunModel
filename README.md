# PredictiveChrunModel

A predictive churn model uses advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to analyse customer data and predict which customers are most likely to churn and take proactive measures to prevent them from churning.These actions may include offering personalised incentives or addressing any concerns or issues that the customer may have.



### Objective and results :
Developed a predictive model to forecast customer churn for an insurance provider. Performed EDA to identify data characteristics and ingested categorical variables into the model using One-Hot Encoding. Balanced dataset through SMOTE technique for minority class and downsampling technique for majority class. Supervised ML models including linear regression, XGBoost, Gradient Boost, and Random Forest were executed, with the Random Forest model with Downsampling outperforming others with 82% accuracy. Model efficiency was validated using precision and recall metrics, and ROC AUC metric resulted in 0.84 score.
